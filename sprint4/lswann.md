### What I accomplished
- I fixed search so it would only search a specifc user's recipes
- I made it so users can un-pin a recipe from the home page after they pin it
- I added the ability for the user to add their own time unit
- I made it so that the section description box only appears when a description was created
- I cleaned up all files in the repo: deleted uneeded whitespace, ensured formatting was consistent, added comments, ect.
- I fixed an issue with the text fields changing color after allowing goolgle to autofill the text box. 
- I reviewed all buttons and ensured that they all worked consistently: the entire button can be cliked and not just the word, 
the text of all buttons chnages on hover, and made the color of the text on hover consistent with the color scheme. 
- I fixed general formatting issues throught the site
