RecipeBox will be a website where users can store and organize recipes. Users will be able to create recipes that contain the recipe's name, time to make, ingredients, and directions. Users will be able to create sections that contain the section's name and description. They can organize their recipes into these sections and/or pin their recipes to their home page. Users will also be able to quickly search for their recipes by keywords using the search bar. The website will also have a shopping list where users can add and delete items. Users will be able to create an account to store their information and be able to login and logout from the website.

## Features
Give at least 8 user stories to describe required features. These can come from the issues assigned to you during the 4 sprints, or you
