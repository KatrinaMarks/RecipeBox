### What you accomplshed
My first priority was allowing users to reset a forgotten password; after some research, I realized
sending an actual email would be a little bit complicated for the scope of this project, so I just have
the reset link appear in the user's terminal window. Next I added two simple features: allowing a user to delete 
a section and allowing a user to delete a recipe. Then I created a new feature, the shopping list, which just allows
user to add or delete items from a list. Someone else added styling to the shopping list page for me, but the last thing
I did was style the account page. This was my first time looking at our style.css file. I also added a few of the requirements
to out readme file and made a few of our powerpoint slides.
