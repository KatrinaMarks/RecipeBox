### What you accomplished
- Created url slugs: I created slugs for each recipe and section so that each page has a unique url.
- Connected sections to recipes in backend: I had to change the relationship between our section and recipe models so that users can add as many recipes as they want to each section. After this, I was able to give the option to select sections on the new recipe page.
- Got add ingredient button working: I got the add ingredient button working using JS and empty-forms. It took some time to get this so that the ingredients were saving to the database.
- Got edit recipe and edit section working: We had a lot of issues with updating recipe and section information but I was able to get it working this sprint.
- Worked on styling throughout the website: I worked on styling for the new recipe page, landing page, and shopping list page.
