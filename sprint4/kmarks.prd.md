# Product Requirements Document
Name: Katrina Marks 

Product Name: RecipeBox

## Background
This product is for people who need to organize recipes. Possible users are 
home cooks, chefs, and anyone who wants a paperless way to easily store and 
find their recipes. This product is also for people who enjoy aethestically 
layed out food blogs, because RecipeBox allows users to make their own sections 
and organize their recipes however they want. This product could also be for 
people who want a cute and paperless shopping list.

For the market opportunity this website would be free, but could possibly
make money from relevant advertisements. It could advertise for food blogs, 
grocery stores, and cookware.

## Project Overview
RecipeBox will be a website where users can store and organize recipes.
Users can store ingredients and instructions as a recipe. Users can create 
sections such as lunch or snacks. They can organize their recipes into these
sections and/or pin their recipes to their home page. Users will also be able to 
quickly search for their recipes by keywords using the search bar. The website
will also have a shopping list where uses can add items and their quantity and 
delete the items. Users will have basic account abilities such as resetting a 
forgotten password, or changing their password or email while logged in.

## Features

8. As a user, I want to store the ingedients and instructions of a recipe so that I can save my favorite recipes.
