# RecipeBox Requirements Document

- Name: Lilian Swann
- Product: RecipeBox

### Background
Most people cook on at least a semi-regular basis, which means that almost everyone has recipes that they
need to store. Some will write them down on note cards and keep them in a little box, some print them out
and keep them in a binder, some take screenshots of the recipes, and others just pray they will be able to
find the recipe again on google when they need it. 

All of the storage options have downsides, obviously, physical storage methods can’t be searched with
keywords to find the desired recipe. The screenshot method crowds your photo gallery, and just hoping you
can find recipes again will eventually lead to disappointment. Clearly, a better solution is needed for
storing recipes. 


### Project Overview
RecipeBox will be a website where people can add their recipes. They will be able to add ingredients,
including amounts and units, directions, time to make and time units. Useres will also have the baility to
create sections for organizing similar recipes. Both recipes and sections will be able to be editied. The
home page will consist of a sections column and a pinned recipes column. Pinned recipes is where users
will be able to keep their most used recpies. Users will also be able to search thier recipes as well as
view a page with all of their recipes. User’s information will be stored in in user’s account so that they
will be able to acess it from anywher, at anytime.

RecipeBox will also have a shopping list feature where users can add items and the quantity that they
need.
