## What I Did Not Do
- I was not able to finish the search bar


## What Problems I Encountered
- I encountered many problems getting the elements of new recipe to allign correctly and 
adpat to screens of diffrent sizes. The way I set it up seemed to be causeing problems. Fatima 
and I worked together to figure out the issue.

- Working on the search bar was dependent on Page finishing with the models. She did not get started 
on her issues until late into the sprint, which means I was unable to connect my work on the search bar
to the actual recipe model.
