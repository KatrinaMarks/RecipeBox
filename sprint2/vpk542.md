### What you did not do
- I accomplished everything I planned to do.


### What problems you encountered
- While creating the landing page, I noticed that I needed to use the recipe_box/templates/registration/login.html file to access the account parts that Katrina has been dealing with. I was able to copy and paste the work I had already done to this page. Now, I've been having problems making this login page the first page on the website. I haven't encountered this problem with the other pages so I'm still trying to figure out the solution. For now, the login page is only accessible through "/login".
- I encountered a formatting problem on the new recipe page. When adding a new ingredient, the input boxes where not formatted properly and I had to rework the code a bit to get it looking more uniform. There still seems to be a problem with the formatting when it's viewed on smaller screens, but that will be an issue to deal with next sprint.

### What you accomplished
- Create landing page: I wrote the html and css code for the landing page using Lili's figma design. This page has our logo, user login, and an option to create an account. The page is found on the "/login" page, eventually it needs to be accessible from the start page.
- Create individual recipe page: I wrote the html and css for the individual recipe page using Lili's figma design. This page is designed to how each recipe should look to the user. It has the recipe title, time, ingredients, and directions. The user is also given options to edit their recipe, add it to their pinned recipes, or add it to a section.
- Work on CSS for new recipe page: Lili was having some trouble with the new recipe page formatting so I worked on the css to try and fix the issues. I was able to get the formatting looking correct when it's viewed on a larger screen, but it still unformatted on small screens.
- Create all recipes page: I wrote the html and css code for the all recipes page using Lili's figma design. This page does not have much on it, but it will show each recipe that the user has created.
