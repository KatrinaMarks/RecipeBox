## What Problems I Encountered

Logo


## What I Accomplished
- I worked closely with Fatima to create a design for the website that is functional and aesthetically pleasing. 
I created a hand drawn layout of each page for the website. I then transalted sevral of the most important pages into an online design.
- I used online tools such as canva and colors.co to create the logo and color pallet. My insperation was old-timey receipe books and recipe stroage containers 
because I wanted the site to have a home-y, classic feel. I created sevral revisions of each, 
we then discussed them as a group and decided on out favorite. The final designs can both be found in the repo.
- I worked on creating the input boxes for the new recipe page, and from there I also completed the new section page as it was based on the same concepts.
 I learned how to add text entry boxes, free form boxes, and drop down menus. The hardest part was adding the add section buttons, 
 but I found a resource online that I was able to base my cod off of. These pages still need to have the CSS added, but they function correctly.
