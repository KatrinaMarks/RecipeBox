# Sprint 1

 - Name: Paige King
 - GitHub id: PaigeKing
 - Group Name: RecipeBox

### What you planned to do

 - create model for recipe name #10
 - create model for ingredients #11
 - create model for instruction #12

### What you did not do

Every item was started but there are more variables to add to each model

### What problems you encountered

I struggled with learning python and django, but I have gotten a little more comfortable,
and I was not able to get my models connected to the front end, but hopefully I will be 
able to in the second sprint

### Issues you worked on

[#10](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/RecipeBox/issues/10) Figure out how to store recipe names
[#11](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/RecipeBox/issues/11) Create storage for ingredients
[#12](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/RecipeBox/issues/12) Create storage for instructions

### Files you worked on

 - RecipeBox/recipe_box/base/recipes/admin.py
 - RecipeBox/recipe_box/base/recipes/apps.py
 - RecipeBox/recipe_box/base/recipes/models.py
 - RecipeBox/recipe_box/base/recipes/tests.py
 - RecipeBox/recipe_box/base/recipes/views.py

### What you accomplished

I created the models for the recipes, ingredients, and instructions. This meant creating
data structures for each and giving them variables that could connect with each other as well.
It wasn't much because I spent a lot of this sprint learning pyhton and django.
