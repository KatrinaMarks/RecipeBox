### What you did not do
- Didn't get user input for recipe directions or recipe section
- Didn't get recipes connected to sections


### What problems you encountered
- After spending more time on the backend this sprint, I realized there were way more issues that needed to be dealt with and I didn't have enough time to work on all of them.
- I struggled with getting edited recipes to update in the database. Since I got creating a new recipe working, I thought updating it would be fairly similar but the code I was using did not work as I expected. I tried error checking and looking for tutorials online but I wasn't able to get it working.
