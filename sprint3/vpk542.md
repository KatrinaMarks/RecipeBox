### What you did not do
- Didn't get user input for recipe directions or recipe section
- Didn't get recipes connected to sections


### What problems you encountered
- While working on my backend issues, I realized there were way more issues that needed to be dealt with and I didn't have enough time to work on all of them.
- I struggled with getting edited recipes to update in the database. Since I got creating a new recipe working, I thought updating it would be fairly similar but the code I was using did not work as I expected. I tried error checking and looking for tutorials online but I wasn't able to get it working.

### Files you worked on
- recipe_box/base/admin.py
- recipe_box/base/forms.py
- recipe_box/base/models.py
- recipe_box/base/urls.py
- recipe_box/base/views.py
- recipe_box/static/styles/style.css
- recipe_box/templates/all_recipes.html

- recipe_box/templates/individual_recipe.html
- recipe_box/templates/individual_section.html
- recipe_box/templates/new_recipe.html
- recipe_box/templates/new_section.html

### What you accomplished
- Connect new recipe user input to backend: I was able to change the new recipe page so that user input can be stored in the database. Users can now pin their recipe and store its title, time, and ingredients. I also set it up so that the recipes a user creates can be found on the all recipes page.
- Connect new section user input to backend: I was able to change the new section page so that the section name and description can be stored. I also set it up so that a user's sections can be found on the home page.
- Fix login page url: I was able to get the home page to redirect to the login page if a user did not have an account.
- Fix urls: I changed and added new urls so that individual recipes and sections could be viewed.
