# Sprint 2

 - Name: Paige King
 - GitHub id: PaigeKing
 - Group Name: RecipeBox

### What you planned to do
 - move recipe models to base #21
 - create views for recipes #22
 - continue section model #23
 - finish recipe, ingredient, and instruction models #24
 - create forms #35

### What you did not do

I did not finish the views.

### What problems you encountered

Because my other group members have already made the templates, its a little like working backwards, but I am getting the hang of it.

### Issues you worked on

[#21](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/RecipeBox/issues/21) Move recipe models
[#22](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/RecipeBox/issues/22) Create views for recipe
[#23](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/RecipeBox/issues/23) Continue making model for section
[#24](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/RecipeBox/issues/24) Finish recipe, ingredient, and instruction models
[#35](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall22/RecipeBox/issues/35) Create forms

### Files you worked on

 - RecipeBox/recipe_box/base/admin.py
 - RecipeBox/recipe_box/base/forms.py
 - RecipeBox/recipe_box/base/models.py
 - RecipeBox/recipe_box/base/views.py

### What you accomplished

I moved my models from a seperate app to the main project directory. Then I fleshed out all
of my models, and started working on the forms, and I have those done at least in their rudimentary form.
After that, I tried to make the views for some of the pages but ran into some issues, but I plan to get those sorted out in the next sprint.
