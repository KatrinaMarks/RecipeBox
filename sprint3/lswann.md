- group: RecipeBox


## What I planned to do
- I will be connecting the recipe models to the home page so that pinned recipes are shown
  - #6
- I wantedo make it so that background of each section on the home page is the section's color.
  - #52
- I will add a page that will display the recipes stored in each section.
  - #45
- Each section has the option to select a color, I will be adding that field to the model so that it can be stored.
  - #42
- I will be working on getting the search bar working so that it actually searches our database and gives the user a list of their recipes in alphabetical order.
  - #28


## What I did not do
- I did not get the section to display its color on the home screen.


## What problems I encountered
- I had a very hard time attempting to display the color of each section on the home page. 
I could not find a tutorial with a similar set up and was nat able to make this part work
- I made it so the search bar searches, however, it searches all recipes stored on the site instead ofjust a singal users recipes. 
this will be fixed in sprint 4.
